# [Midterm Lab Task 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19892874/MidtermLab.Halili.xlsx)
This portfolio Demonstrates the process of data normalization and cleaning applied to a transactional database. The dataset consists of multiple related tables, each designed to improve data organization and eliminate redundancy.
# Step by Step Process
Step 1:
* Load the raw file
* Fix collumns width and height
* TRIM words and spaces
* Remove Null values
* Remove Duplciates

Step 2:
* Performed 1NF
* Perform Tablet spilt using 2NF
* Performed 2NF
* Mapped the normalization as a physical data model
